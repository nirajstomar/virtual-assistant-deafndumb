If voice is the future of computing interfaces, what about those who have hearing or speaking disability? All products developed today should be able to be used by us equally, so we are to create something that would give back to others. Our systems takes in input1 in the form of sign language converts it to text, which is then spoken loud by the device (on which the system is running) this is fed to Google Assistant/Alexa as input2 , the response is converted to text and displayed on the screen and also spoken loud by the device.  This way people with hearing or speaking disability can communicate with a virtual assistant.
